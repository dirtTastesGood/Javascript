# Visual change counter

## Objective: 

You are the owner of a small retail store and need a better way for your cashier to calculate the change due to a customer by visually showing them the change due.

Assume that the cost of the sale is known (e.g. $9.58), and allow me (the user of the application) to enter that value numerically. [include validation for positive numerical values only]

Allow me to then visually select the "currency" (represented by bills and coins) handed to me by the customer.

Finally, represent the change due to the buyer visually in "currency" (represented by bills and coins).

*The application will be judged by its completeness, as well as your thoughtful additions to usability, validation, helpful hints, and other personalization that make it user-friendly.

**You will not be judged on your art skills to create "currency" icons, however whatever represents the currency should be identifiable as a bill or coin and it's denomination.
